# Solver-Navier-Stokes-and-advection-convection-equations
This is a code that solves the problem of pollutant transport in a river using the Navier-Stokes equations to model the river and the Advection-Convection equations for pollutant transport.  It is solved through the use of finite element techniques, using the FEniCS package.
